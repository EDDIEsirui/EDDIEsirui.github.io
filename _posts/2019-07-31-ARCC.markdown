**This program runs multiple programs in the summer and gap seasons; ARCC is looked to as the standard for delivering quality, fulfilling and enriching programs for our participants.**

- Cleaned up waste on the beach, hoping to protect the native sea turtles and the cay ecosystem; 
- Helped in a special homeless restaurant in LA; 
- Organized fundraising events through local nonprofits; 
- Our trip to Hawaii helped me understand the delicate bond between locals and the environment.
