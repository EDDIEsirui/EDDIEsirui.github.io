**I am inventing a product that can increasingly lift the life quality of the blind and visually impaired, and eliminate their self-inferiority using special devices.**
- I am now learning computer vision and basic deep learning with a postgraduate at Carnegie Mellon University. 
- I plan to finish my project at the end of this year and put it into use among some blind people, so that I can attain invaluable feedback and get further improvements in the future.
