**I had courses focusing on fundamental aspects of fluid flow behavior & basic principles about microfluidic devices.**
- I learned fluid dynamics utilized in biomechanical fields. 
- I got familiar with concepts like viscosity, viscous fluid flows, flow through pipes, and so on.
- Based on the research, I wrote a paper about sperm sorting using microfluidic devices. The paper was published by IOP Conference Series "Journal of Physics" ISSN: 1742-6596.
