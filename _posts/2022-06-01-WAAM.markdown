**I had courses focusing on fundamental aspects of fluid flow behavior. I learned basic principles about microfluidic devices and fluid dynamics utilized in biomechanical fields. I also got familiar with concepts like viscosity, viscous fluid flows, flow through pipes, and so on.**
- Based on the research, I wrote a paper about sperm sorting using microfluidic devices. The paper was published by IOP Conference Series "Journal of Physics" ISSN: 1742-6596.
